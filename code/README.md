# Line Following Robot 🚗

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates an autonomous line-following robot that detects and follows a predefined path using IR sensors. The robot processes sensor data using an Arduino microcontroller and controls motor movement through a motor driver for smooth and accurate navigation.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
In many industrial and academic applications, robots are required to move along a fixed path without human intervention. Manual control is inefficient and error-prone. This project solves the problem by enabling automatic path tracking using sensor-based decision making.

## 🛠️ Hardware Components
- Arduino Uno / Nano
- IR Sensor Module
- L298N Motor Driver
- DC Motors
- Robot Chassis
- Battery Pack
- Connecting Wires

## 💻 Software & Tools
- Arduino IDE
- Embedded C/C++
- Fritzing (for wiring diagram)

## ⚙️ Working Principle
1. IR sensors continuously detect the line on the surface.
2. Sensor outputs are read by the Arduino.
3. Based on sensor values, the Arduino decides motor direction.
4. Motor driver controls the speed and direction of the motors.
5. The robot adjusts its movement to stay on the path.

## ✨ Features
- Fully autonomous navigation
- Accurate line detection
- Smooth turning mechanism
- Compact and low-cost design

## 🧪 Results
